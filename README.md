The Formfactor has remained the same for the new PCB and some of the components have been slightly reoriented to make room for the new electronics. Powered by the same CR2032 coin cell with firmware enhancements to improve battery life.

The enclosure is now fitted with two large 12x3 mm neodymium magnets for better strength to remain stuck with a metallic surface like a refrigerator or a whiteboard.
